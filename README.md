# Module 5. Logic and Control Flow - Lesson 02.01: Conditional Statements and Nesting
## ✅ Step 1 – 3: Core Concepts, Examples, and Quiz

---

## 🧠 Step 1: Explore the Topic

### What Are Conditional Statements?
Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions. These are core control flow tools:

- `if` – runs code if the condition is true
- `else if` – adds alternate conditions
- `else` – runs when all previous conditions are false
- Nested conditionals – place one `if` inside another

### Why It Matters
Without conditional logic, programs can't respond to different inputs, user actions, or system states. This is what makes code dynamic and smart.

## 🌍 Step 2: Real-World Examples

### 1. Handwashing Reminder
```javascript
if (time === 'before dinner') {
  console.log("Don't forget to wash your hands!");
}
```

### 2. Grading System
```javascript
if (score >= 90) {
  console.log("Grade: A");
} else if (score >= 80) {
  console.log("Grade: B");
} else if (score >= 70) {
  console.log("Grade: C");
} else {
  console.log("Grade: F");
}
```

### 3. Weather + Fuel-Based Driving Decision
```javascript
if (weather === 'clear') {
  if (fuelLevel > 50) {
    console.log("Go for a drive!");
  } else {
    console.log("Refuel first.");
  }
} else {
  console.log("Better stay home.");
}
```

### 4. Discount Eligibility
```javascript
if (isMember) {
  if (total >= 100) {
    console.log("You get 15% off!");
  } else {
    console.log("You get 10% off!");
  }
}
```
